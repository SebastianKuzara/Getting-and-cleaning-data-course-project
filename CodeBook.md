#### This codebook descrabing variables from db_sub.txt data set
##### There are 2 descriptive variables:
###### - subjectMean - it is volunteer ids in a range of 1 to 30, Each number is one volunteer
###### - activityMean - 6 kind of activities that volunteers performed

##### There are also 79 variable contain avarange of variables on mean and sd from main data set for each subject and each activity. Detailed description of these 79 variables (and more) is in the features_info.txt file in original directory from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip . More information is also in README.txt file in the same directory.
